# GANs-for-1D-Signal
## Introduction
This repo contains pytorch implementations of several types of GANs, including DCGAN, WGAN and WGAN-GP, for 1-D signal. It was used to generate fake data of Raman spectra, which are typically used in Chemometrics as the fingerprints of materials.

## Requirements

- python 3.7.8
- pytorch 1.6.0
- numpy 1.19.2

### WGAN

### WGAN-GP

**NOTE:** RMSprop was used in the implementation of wgan-gp, rather than Adam, which was used in its original version, as it seemed like Adam didn't work well in my applications.

## Usage

### data

You need to put all your data in the same folder in txt format, and make sure they are column vector.

### network

The length of signal in my application is 1824, you need to modify the networks according to your data.

### train

Run python file end with "train".
